The project is basically to predict the lungs diseases in the four classes such like as the Tuberculosis, corona virus Pneumonia and normal. T
The technique which i have used here that is convolutional neural network technique and the randome forest we have basically the the compare both the techniques and analyze that which one giving the best result.
We also predicting one of the dangerous disease like lungs cancer which is predicting either possitive or negative.
The modal has working on the step by step approach such as data cleaning, data preprocessing, data analysing , feature extraction and modal deployment.
We have approximate 2000 grayscale image of lungs cancer and greater than 8000 images is categorized in 4 classes.
In the modal deployment we use the flask library and it will be integrated of HTML, CSS AND JAVA SCRIPT.
